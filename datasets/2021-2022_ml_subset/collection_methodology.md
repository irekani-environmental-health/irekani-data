   - Inter-rater reliability assessment
   - Training feedback

3. **Supervisor Review**:
   - Daily review of completed interviews
   - Immediate feedback to Citizen Scientists
   - Identification of training gaps

### Post-Collection

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardization of open-text responses

## 🔢 Sample Characteristics

### Final Sample Size

**Original Dataset**: ~500 interviews collected during field work (2021-2022)
**Published Complete Dataset**: 288 participants (after data cleaning and quality control)
**ML Subset**: 127 participants (definitive health perception responses)

**Note**: The original field work collected nearly 500 interviews. After rigorous data validation, quality control, and removal of incomplete or inconsistent responses, the final published dataset includes 288 high-quality records suitable for scientific analysis.

### Response Rate

- **Interviews collected**: ~500
- **Published dataset**: 288 participants (after quality control)
- **Retention rate**: 58% (from raw data to published dataset)

**Reasons for non-participation**:
- No time / too busy (45%)
- Not interested (30%)
- Suspicious of research purposes (15%)
- Language barrier (5%)
- Other (5%)

### Representativeness

**Not a probability sample**, but efforts made to ensure diversity:
- Range of farm sizes (0.5 to 100+ hectares)
- Multiple crop types
- Different farming systems (rainfed, irrigated)
- Age range: 18-85 years
- Education levels: no formal education to postgraduate
- Both genders (though agricultural workers predominantly male)

**Limitations**:
- Convenience sampling may miss certain populations
- Self-selection bias (those with strong opinions more likely to participate)
- Language barrier may have excluded some indigenous speakers

**Ethical Framework**: Declaration of Helsinki principles followed

**Risk Assessment**: Minimal risk to participants
- No physical interventions
- No collection of biological samples
- Standard survey questions
- Full anonymization

### Data Protection

1. **Anonymization**:
   - No names, addresses, phone numbers collected
   - GPS coordinates aggregated to municipal level
   - Exact dates removed
   - Community names removed
   - Small cell sizes suppressed if needed for privacy

2. **Secure Storage**:
   - Encrypted during transmission
   - Access restricted to research team
   - Audio recordings deleted after validation
   - Raw data with any identifiers never shared

3. **Participant Rights**:
   - Right to refuse participation
   - Right to skip questions
   - Right to withdraw (during interview)
   - Right to request data deletion

### Community Engagement

**Results Sharing**:
- Summary findings presented to communities
- Workshop with agricultural organizations
- Policy brief for local government
- Academic publications acknowledge community contribution

**Reciprocity**:
- Information sessions on agrochemical safety
- Connections to agricultural extension services
- Citizen Scientists remain community resources
